        <h2>Cinder Hill Engine House Excavation</h2>
        <p class="text-left">The excavation at Bottoms Mill began in 2011. Cinder Hill Engine House was originally marked on a map as an engine house. We decided to investigate this. Upon further inspection we discovered that this location used to be a mill, and was later converted into cottages for the workers of a new engine house that was built further downstream from here. Bottoms Mill is located in the picturesque heart of the Holcombe Valley. This location is currently in its last year of being excavated.</p>

        <h2>Lost Farms</h2>
        <p class="text-left">This project is our longest, and our main objective as a group. We are trying to discover information about the number of farms that once dotted the landscape of the Holcombe Valley. We have currently collected a lot of old photographs of these such farms. If you have any photographs of this, we urge you to please send them to us to help further our research. So far we have discovered information about 10 farms. We also have 4 images of farms that we cannot recognise. If you can help us identify these farms, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Dover Chapel</h2>
        <p class="text-left">Dover Chapel is a small building, located within the village of Greenmount. In June 2012, Greenmount Village held a special Jubilee party. HMHG undertook lots of activities including: a metal detector treasure hunt for the kids, other childrens games and competitions and a big display of who we were and what we do. As if that wasn't enough - we also did a Community Dig! The dig was a success. We attracted lots of interest from passers by, got some people who had never dug before to join in and even signed up some new members! On the 28th and 29th July 2012 we started a full scale dig.</p>
